# Sandy's web experiments

This is where my learning and experimentation with web technologies and webpage designs takes place. I am still a beginner, so the contents are fairly sparse, not to mention of a low quality.  
I also intend to test as many of my future pages as possible with Opera Mini 8 on my Nokia 7230. I would also test its built-in browser, but it is too old to support modern encryption methods.
